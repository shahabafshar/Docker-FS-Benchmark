# Docker operations benchmarks
# This script simulates Docker operations benchmarking, as these operations
# would typically be performed outside this container by the host script.
# The actual Docker benchmarks measure:
# 1. Image pull time - measures the performance of pulling container images
# 2. Image build time - measures the performance of building images from Dockerfiles
# 3. Container start/stop time - measures the latency of container instantiation

# Set target directories with defaults
TARGET_DIR=${TARGET_DIR:-/data}
OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR:-/data/results}

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_DIR}"

echo "Running Docker benchmarks on ${TARGET_DIR}"

# Note: Since we're running inside a container and can't access the Docker daemon,
# this script acts as a placeholder. The actual Docker benchmarks are performed
# by the run_benchmarks.sh script running on the host.
echo "Note: This is a simulation as Docker-in-Docker is not used."
echo "Docker pull time benchmark would go here"
echo "Docker build time benchmark would go here"
echo "Docker container start/stop benchmark would go here"

# For reference, here's what the host script measures:
# 1. Time to pull the alpine:latest image
# 2. Time to build a simple Python container
# 3. Time to start and stop containers (averaged over 10 runs)

echo "Docker benchmarks complete. Results would be saved to ${OUTPUT_DIR}"
